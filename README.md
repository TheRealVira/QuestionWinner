# QuestionWinner

This program may seem a bit cheaty to you, but trust me - it is :sparkles::smirk::sparkles::sparkles:

## How do I add my own questions and answers?
The instructions are simple, if you've read the [wiki](https://github.com/TheRealVira/QuestionWinner/wiki).

## How does this magic work?
I kind of use a hak for this hak to work! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
It's based on DllImports and if you want to know more about changing some crazy flags, you should take a look at this [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute(v=vs.110).aspx).
